# GMusic Organizer

A node.js playlist organizer for google play music running in a terminal. Powered by [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) and [playmusic](https://github.com/jamon/playmusic).


## Installation

The dependency tree contains native node.js modules. Parts of them need to be compiled during installation. So you need a C++ toolchain (compiler/linker) on your machine.

#### Ubuntu 16.04

`sudo apt-get install libasound-dev`

`sudo npm install -g gmusic-organizer`

#### Mac OS

`sudo npm install -g gmusic-organizer`

## Usage

After installation restart your terminal window. Start with `gmusic-organizer`.

When starting the first time, you need to enter your google credentials.

If the login step fails, you might need to:
- allow less [secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)  to work with your account
- create an [app specific password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) (usually required when two-factor authentication is enabled
) 

After a successful authentication, a master token is created and stored in `~/.gmusic-organizer`.

Hit `h` to get a list of available controls.
